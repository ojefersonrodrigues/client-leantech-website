# Leantech One-Page Website
A simple one-page website I built back in 2020 for a local tech &amp; automation business I worked at. Just showcasing it here as part of my portfolio.

## 🧾 Project Overview
This is a single-page website I built with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4**. I created it around **March 2020** for **Leantech Automação Comercial**, a company I worked at during that time.

The business focuses on IT support and commercial automation for local businesses, offering services such as POS systems, barcode scanners, printers, backup solutions, and more.

This website was designed to present the company’s services, products, and contact details in a clean and modern layout.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Bootstrap 4  

I chose this stack because it is one of the main techs I was using at the time. I built the website using a couple of minutes daily during one week on work time.
